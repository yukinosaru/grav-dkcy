I love japanese food in all its glorious (and sometimes disgusting) forms! But one of the most irresistible things is gyoza. Lovely juicy dumplings of umami and saltiness, with the right blend of soft, steamed wrapper and a crunchy base.  
 I generally buy big bags of them from my local asian supermarket (Angkor) – they’re really easy to cook up and present beautifully. Cue instagram photos.

I figured that they were tricky to make and having a bag of frozen gyoza ready to go was too convenient to bother exploring. But I thought I’d have a go – bought some sausage meat.  
 It was only when I got it home that I realised it was already pre-seasoned, so I thought I’ll just add some asian ingredients to give it some distinct flavours.  
 Grated ginger and garlic, soy and sesame oil. Dash of five spice. Normally has cabbage in it, but I only had spring onions, so I figured they would do.  
 Squished it all up – worked it quite hard as I wanted it to break down and bit and then become more cohesive and stick together.

Bought pre-made wrappers – looking at the ingredients, it should be straightforwrad to make, but figured this would do to start.

Shaping was a little tricky to work out, but I looked at one of my frozen gyoza and tried to reverse engineer it using what I know about making curry puffs. Eventually worked out a nice method – 1 teaspoon per wrapper, wet the edge of the wrapper to help seal it – folded it and loosely pinched the center. Then starting on one side, pleated the edges and pinched to seal before repeating on the other – ended up with about 3 pleats per side.

Tada! Gyoza, done. I put them on a baking sheet and popped them in the freezer until frozen, then dropped them into a box for future.

Cooking – hot non-stick pan, bit of oil, add gyoza for about a minute or so, 50ml of water, lower heat and cover (steams them), remove cover and turn up heat, when the liquid has evaporated then they start to crisp up. Don’t be tempted to try to move them, they’ll move when they’re ready. Tip one up to check how it’s going, remove them when the base is crispy and golden.

I like to plate them up on their side so you can see the pleats as well as the crispy base – I tend to fan them out in a circle as I think that matches their shape well, but if you have some rectangular plate, then a straight line works too.

Dipping sauce – soy, sometimes mixed 50:50 with rice vinegar. Whatever you want really!

Addendum: I had a few extra wrappers so thought I’d experiment a bit. Chopped up Beaumont cheese and some local saucisson – bosh! Gyoza savoyard ð&#159;&#153;&#130;
