So, I’ve decided to start a mood diary. Not sure if keeping it here is the best idea, but it’s the easiest way and at the moment I need easy ways.

I’m here in Japan, ‘living the dream’, ‘following my own path’ and all that crap. But am I? I’ve been feeling lost for a while now and only recently realised that it’s probably a form of depression. I’ve always had ups and downs in my life and for a time recognised this as a cycle of personal growth. Only now I’ve reached a point where I’m no longer sure of myself, how I feel, where I’m going or what I’m doing.

Today I had planned to get up early, eat good food and have a day of cleaning and applying for a job at International Alert. I woke up around 7 just before my alarm and flipped open my laptop to check emails. My wrist was hurting a lot this morning (probably cos of the rescue training yesterday). After that, my mind was free running. Thoughts were exploding around my head, generally worries.

AAC – needs to be cleaner, feel like I’m failing. Feel like the mess doesn’t help me. Things I need to do, but no motivation to do them.

NOASC – feel unresolved. Feel like I’m failing and not giving a good impression of myself. Don’t enjoy rafting and don’t enjoy the company of the other guides. Feel isolated and not part of a team – partly because of language issues and anti-gaijin attitudes. Done well to get myself some media-related work (video editing), but feel like it’s been dumped on me, video quality is crap, so I worry that I won’t produce a decent product – worry that a shit video will be seen as a reflection of my ability. So I’m procrastinating – also don’t really want to go into office and feel judged. Because it’s not getting done and needs to be done by the end of the month, I’m worrying that it won’t be done and I’ll get in trouble or be judged further. Don’t want to let myself down and want to show what I can do.

Money – not earning enough money to pay rent. Worry about service charge for Britxon flat. Can’t afford to enjoy myself here and actually see Japan. Worry about US bank account and my new card being sent somewhere – so someone steals my money or the government closes my account. Worry about tax return from the UK – think I can get money back from HMRC cos I overpaid last year, but haven’t done anything about it and worry I’ll lose that chance. Also haven’t filled a tax return for letting out my flat – worry I’ll get in trouble for that. Worry about my Softbank phone – need to call and cancel the relevant bits.

Life – don’t know what I’m doing or why I’m here. Am I being selfish? Am I running away from my life? Have I created this nobel, inspirational story to hide the simple fact that I can’t deal with authority and feel I can always do things better? Should I be doing something more worthwhile – should I go for this International Alert job? What if I get it? Should I go work at Be@One? Should I do a job in order to get money to do the things I want to do? Like own a cafe or move to the Alps. Will working for IA mean missing out on the opportunity to live and work in Canada and NZ or Aus?

Michelle – do I love her? Should we split up? Should I go to Bangladesh and try living together? I feel guilty that she’s supporting me so much emotionally and financially.

Health – I’ve lost weight and feel low on energy. My wrist still hurts after a few weeks now – is it broken? Do I risk tendonitis or long-term trouble?

Family – feel like I’m ignoring them. Don’t want to talk to them cos I find them frustrating to handle and boring. Nothing in common. Brings out negative behaviours in me.

Work – worry that I’ve been out of regular work for so long that I won’t be able to go back to it.

Relationships – Hywel – worry that he’s all alone and I’m not being a good enough friend. Worry that he’ll hurt himself. Worry about Jo. Jen – miss her and want to know what’s going on in her life. Feel hurt that she’s shut me out and want to resolve that. Jenny – feel bad I missed her wedding and feel that she thinks I’m a bad friend.

Should I go home and ‘heal’? I’m clearly not well mentally at the moment. Half-decided that at least monitoring thoughts will be useful, hence this. So today I’m feeling low and un-enthused. Ai called this morning, but my phone was off – they went to Goshiki Onsen, but I didn’t want to. Made udon soup, but still feel like eating. Noticed myself consciously rationing food, thinking ‘I’ve only got 2 eggs left’, ‘won’t have meat cos have very little left’ – clearly constrained by money. Feel like I’m making food at the moment as something to do, to make myself feel more constructive. What am I doing? I’m just getting up, doing nothing really, then going to sleep. Is this the grand experience I wished for and told everyone about? Is this really living? Or merely surviving?
