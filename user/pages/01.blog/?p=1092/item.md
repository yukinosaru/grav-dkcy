**30 June 2010, 2200 – Royal International Hotel, Khulna**  
 Driving along foreign-built, well maintained roads, the surrounding landscape melts from city to farmland, from semi-flooded jute fields (jute is relatively flood-resistant) to shrimp ponds (an indication of the salinity of the water). It’s a dramatic visual illustration of how flooding and salinity have altered lifestyles and agricultural practices.  
 We stop in Faridpur for a typically Bangladeshi lunch of rice, dal and vegetables, before taking the final leg to Khulna. The road from Faridpur is straight and long, raised up above the fields along the path of a former railway.  
 Khulna is a small city compared to Dhaka and although it’s the capital of Khulna division, the streets are relatively clear and uncrowded. Driving is a lot easier!  
 A small demonstration is taking place near our hotel – these are pro-opposition (Khaleda Begum, Bangladesh National Party) supporters, demonstrating against earlier demonstrations for Jatta (a religious party), which were in turn a response to the recent deaths of two Jatta during the nationwide hartal (general strike) against government corruption (Sheikh Hasina, Awami League). It’s hard to find a better example of Bangladeshi politics in action.  
 Arif and I head out to explore, wandering through the Khulna New Market – a quite developed shopping area with clean and varied stores. We eat a simple dinner of root and chicken kebabs before hopping on a rickshaw back. The evening closes with a quick cha by the roadside, strong and sweet as always.
