As I lay in bed on a lazy sunday morning, reading news about Bankgok, political commentary on our elections and the state of the climate debate I can’t help but feel that things are accelerating. So what should our response be?  
 Last night I eagerly followed a Twitter debate between [Vinay Gupta](http://www.twitter.com/leashless) (of [Hexayurt](http://www.hexyurt.com) project), [Alex Evans](http://www.twitter.com/alexevans) and [David Steven](http://www.twitter.com/davidsteven) (both [Global Dashboard](http://www.globaldashboard.com) and NYU, which set me off thinking. Vinay was attributing failure to governments, with David and Alex arguing that this was futile – instead we needed resilience. We needed a sense of everyone playing a part, eveyone pulling together, a resilience of values and trying to identify what it was we were trying to protect (they went into more detail in this article for Renewal) . link to article. But predicated on the desire to return to normal.  
 The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks.  
 They advocate a resilience doctrine based on risk-management.

Maturana and varela, in their work on cybernetics point to structural coupling. This is the way that a living system responds to its external evnironemnt by changing its organisation, it’s structure. This doesn’t necessarily mean the physical structure, but the systems, the connections, the relationships between its various functions.  
 Structural coupling means that a living system is the product of its history, its ontology. It’s like a living record of how its external environment has changed.  
 So for us, the failings of government are the failings of our system. They are as much our failings as they are power-hungry elites who appoint themselves to make decisions on our behalf – for our own good. We need to find not just a new politics, but a new governance. One where we don’t look to government for the answers and point the finger when they don’t deliver. But where civil society takes on more than a tub-thumping banner-waving role, more than ‘holding government to account’, more than co-option. Civil society needs to transform, to find better ways of organising itself and we as individuals and societies need to find better ways to collectively make collective decisions that affect the whole.  
 The degree of complexity of our society means that this can’t be through traditional, Cartesian, understand and decide. We need a more complex response, one that necessitates letting go of certainty of outcome, of understanding the chain of causality. One that recognises failure as a source of innovation and an vital part of a resilient society. One in which there are no silver bullets, where we take a shotgun approach to problem solving, trying multiple solutions (perhaps evolutionary approach is a less violent metaphor!).  
 The very nature of paradigm shift is that we cannot understand the new paradigm, that we reject it as outside the norms of our current paradigm. Therefore the challenge is to communicate this, not just phyiscally/verbally/vocally, but culturally and through values.

Elections as a failure of collective intelligence, but that’s a misunderstanding. Collective intelligence isn’t about the majority rule. It’s the decisions that are made by systems as a whole, through individual agents making decisions for themselves. The majority choice of decision is not necessarily reflected in the collective decision or outcome.  
 It’s like the hundreds of banker making decisions in order to earn money to fulfil their needs and desires, to look after their family and friends, that ultimately resulted in a collective outcome, a collective system burp that resulted in threatening those very things.

Democracy – ontology – have we really not come up with a better way of making collective decisions thatn the greeks?? Other cultures too. But these were systems for small scale – not a matter of scaling up, delviering at scale. Linearly scaling a solution to match a exponentially more complex problem is not hte answer, need to find NEW solutions. Lessons from history? How did greek democracy evolve? How can we co-evolve a new democracy? One that allows the collective intelligence space to breathe and grow. Or perhaps we have already found it (or it’s found us!)? Consciously trying to create one falls victim to the very things that we’re trying to change – cartesian, causality. Do we jsut need to let things go? Be mindful of the times, take advantage of opporunities when they emerge.

Keep calm and carry on.
