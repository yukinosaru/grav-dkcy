1454. 5th December. On my way to copenhagen to take part in the most important climate negotiation to date. Ringside seats to the greatest show this decade.  
 Yet I want to be anywhere else but here. It will be a long and tiring fortnight where I’ll be endlessly busy, but will ultimately not contribute to anything. Surrounded by people who genuinely believe they are changing the world. Who are enthralled by their own sense of self importance and the spectacle, the theatre of negotiations. Printing t-shirts, telling others how important they are, patting each other on the backs and enjoying being part of the climate circuit.

Climate change is symbolic of the challenge of our generation – how to deal with global issues and find a way through to a more harmonious way of being. We know the science, we know the poorest will suffer first and worst. We know that we need to reduce emissions from developed countries and limitation of developing country emissions. We know that we need substantial amounts of money to make this happen and to adapt to the worst effects. But we don’t seem to have realised that to do this needs change. Not just input economy and society but in our worldview and the way we run our countries, businesses and families. The way we interact with each other and the choices we make about each others’ lives.  
 Copenhagen will deliver an agreement. It can’t not. Even if the actual deal is worthless. Yet even if we get everything we ask for, the holy Grail of an ‘ambitious global deal’, then what? What will really change? ‘but we will have the political will!’ but these changes can’t come top down. What will it do to change public opinion? Will it change the way that businesses operate and make decisions? Will it stop glacial retreat? Will it protect poor people’s water supply? No.  
 Copenhagen is part of the solution, a step along the way, but the work is only just starting. There’s so much more to do and the thousands of self-righteous changemakers who will say they were there and claim their piece of the wall, they can carry on believing in their own image and living in their tent. I for one will be glad to be outside.
