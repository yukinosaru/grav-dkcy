I find myself being drawn into the vortex of ambition and ego. In doing what I always do, I’ve drawn attention to myself and am now in a very enviable position of being pulled into the inner circle for the end game at Copenhagen. Deeply flattering and I’m pretty pleased with myself, particularly given the short amount of time that I’ve been here. Yet I find myself worrying about it. A combination of “am I up to it?” and “hey look at me!” simultaneously inflating my ego and casting a long shadow of self doubt. I worry because I’ll want to do a good job and not let anyone down, yet also am increasingly tired and fed up of this process driven party, so may not be able to keep my energy and motivation up. An enormous amount of faith has been placed on me and expectation to deliver. And I am blown away at being handed this opportunity. To walk back into government and straight into the heart of the most important negotiation on climate change for 12 years is beyond my wildest fantasies.  
 But a big part of me wants to run away, to slope my shoulders and palm off the stress. Is this the nub of my itinerant few years? Am I scared of the challenge, of really taking a chance and stepping out of my comfort zone? My comfort zone has been so large, that it’s been a long time since I found the edge of it. Yet I now stand on the brink.  
 I’ve never backed away from a challenge – but is that true? I’ve never backed down from a challenge I knew I could complete, but this one is not certain, I’m not sure of myself. Is that because this is bigger? Or have I lost my certainty and arrogance of youth? Do I see more risks because I know more, a case of ignorance being bliss?  
 I’m uncomfortable with where I am, because it’s uncertain, unknown. I claim to be … You know what? That keeps coming up, that sense of self doubt, that “I think I’m this, but am I?”. Partly to cover my arse and hide arrogance, but also from doubt and seeking reassurance. And an overwhelming desire to challenge my feelings and assumptions in a perhaps misguided attempt to eliminate intellectual inertia. Yet the desire to challenge will leave me without stability. I’m actively disrupting my world through fear of stagnation. Through a desire for newness and freshness.
