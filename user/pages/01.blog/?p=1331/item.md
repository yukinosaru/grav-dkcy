I’ve been thinking a lot about male mental health and what I should do about it – I read an article by Jen Offord (@inspireajen) in Standard Life (an excellent online magazine, please read it and donate to its success if you agree), about her brother’s suicide, which made me realise that I needed to write about it (thanks Jen). So, World Suicide Prevention Day seemed a good a day as any to try to write about Gavin.

How do I even start? How do I even describe it? I’ve struggled with this basic step. Fudging with allusions and euphemisms.  
 He committed suicide? Makes it sound like a crime.  
 He died by suicide? Sounds like a car accident.  
 He was taken by suicide? Where to? On holiday? Too passive  
 He took his own life? Makes it sound like a straight choice.

I still don’t have the answer, but I like to think of it as the end of a chronic illness – my friend was ill and in the end that illness beat him. Yes, at some point, he chose to kill himself, but he wasn’t crazy, it wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment thing. Organised and considered way – handing over passwords, specifying funeral music. It was the endpoint of a long and painful process, when no hope was left in sight.

I haven’t really talked about it because I don’t want to. I don’t want to bring people down. I don’t want to worry people. I don’t like feeling sad. Because I’m still dealing with it and don’t feel a need to talk. I haven’t pushed it away either – when the waves of grief come crashing down around me, I stop what I’m doing and face them. Often in private. But I realised that maybe talking or writing about it isn’t just for me. It’s also helping tell the story of suicide in another way.

Having been through various phases of grief, there are several feelings that keep coming back to me.  
 Guilt – could I have done more? I reached out to him in the last few months cos I knew something was up, but I didn’t get a response. Did he push me away? Should I have persevered?  
 Not able to really share with his family – wanting to comfort his mum but dissolving into a mess when she told me that he talked about me even at the end.  
 Disturbed because that could have been me (there, I said it). We were similar and had been through many of the same things – I too have struggled with severe depressive episodes and bout of sanxiety throughout my adult life. I call it my black dog, that follows me around, occassionally pouncing and taking me out. Now, I want to make clear that I’m not suicidal by any stretch, but neither was Gavin, yet here we are. And it scares me that I’m not angry, I don’t find it unbelievable – I can sse why he did it, why he wanted to step off this merry-go-round – the absurdity of it all, our insignficance in the grand scheme of existence. Suicide happens to other people, but it happened to one of us – to the best of us. That frightens me.  
 Sadness that someone so so loved could not feel that, that such love was not enough to lift the cloud of darkness from his soul.  
 Wanting to know how – morbid details, too polite to ask and too scared that the truth might be altogether more violent than I am prepared to believe.  
 Most of all, an emptiness – an irreversible, emptiness that will never be filled. Like realising something isn’t where it should be.

It’s made me more impatient and intolerant – of things that are a waste of energy and time. Of others causing harm to others. I need to work on this, but that doesn’t make it not true.

But it has also filled me with love and made me realise how precious and fragile so many of my friendships are. I’ve reached out to people to let them know that I care, I’ve tried to heal damaged relationships in my life. I’ve vowed to love harder and cherish every moment.  
 It has made me even more determined to help my son Isaac to be as well-armed as he can and more determined to build our relationship so that we can help each other.

Mental health is society’s dirty little secret. It’s a blind spot where we have failed. Failed to prevent the causes and failed to support those affected.  
 It’s an almost exclusively male problem. The response is to encourage men to talk about it, to say “it’s OK to cry” – but I think the problem is deeper than that. It’s finding the tools that can heal that pain, it’s lifting the pressures that society places on us. It’s a long and hard path – even for those that are well-equipped, that are open and “in touch with the feminine side”.

There is no punchline to this, no neat resolution or book-ending – no stoic steely resolve nor hopeless despair. I wanted to share with no other purpose than that, no deeper message, just to show you my wound and point to the bits that are still weeping and the edges that are knitting over, but will never be the same.

So thank you Gavin, for coming into my life, for all the good times and the not so good ones – this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.  
 And thank you dear reader, whoever you are, wherever you are.
