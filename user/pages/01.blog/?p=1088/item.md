**Wed 30 June 2010, 0900, in a spacious, clean and very cold people carrier**  
![](http://user47216.vs.easily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/20100630_0845-200x133.jpg "Viva Argentina!")Enormous flags float lazily in the breeze, suspended from bamboo poles. Mainly Argentina and Brazil, but the odd Portugal, Germany, Spain and much to my delight, English flag. Yes, the World Cup is here – Bangladesh may not be represented, but that doesn’t mean they’re not part of it.

I’m heading out west from Dhaka on the main road to Khulna, at the start of a 3 week placement with WaterAid Bangladesh, supporting the team in responding to climate change. Our climate change programme officer, Arif, is accompanying me on this set of field visits in the flood and cyclone prone Western division of Bangladesh.

We’ll be visiting several of our programme partners, who deliver our projects on the ground. This time, we’ll be focusing on 3 groups of communities are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and climatic variability – urban slums, riverine chars (silt islands) and coastal areas.

Disasters like this have become more common in recent years – on average there has been a major flood event every 3 years over the last 20 years (it was 1 in 4 for the 20 years prior to that). On average, there has been a cyclone every year for the past 20 years – the 20 years before that, cyclones were a 1 in 3 year event. Most recently, Cyclone Aila tore through the lives of the south-west coastal belt.

However, it’s extremely difficult to directly attribute these changes to climate change (although we can say that the likelihood of these events is likely to increase), and even more so to understand how climate change will affect sanitation and water in the future – the reality of the nature of these impacts is much more complex and uncertain. This is why we are trying to understand what’s happening and how we can help communities to manage the uncertainty. My role here at WaterAid is to help develop and drive our policy change agenda on climate change and water security as a whole. Bangladesh is the first country that we will be looking at more closely to understand the implications of climate change.
