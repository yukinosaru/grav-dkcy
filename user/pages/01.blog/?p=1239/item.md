Negash Lodge, Weliso  
 0700, sitting in the garden having breakfast and somewhat unsuccessfully trying to find a quiet spot

Nearly three months after arriving in Addis Ababa, I feel as if I’ve been here for years. Feeling quite settled with a home, the emergence of routine and friends. Challenges still remain but it feels very different.  
 Work wise, I feel like I need to sharpen my tools and refresh my skills that have dulled over time and through lack of use. This is good, but intimidating and full of the usual self doubt. I came here in the belief of doing something new, something different – which is largely the reality but tempered by day to day.  
 I guess the question is whether I feel like I’ve moved on in my personal journey. I think so but time will tell – I feel like something is crystallising again and I’m entering another phase. More cynical, more world weary and less idealistic – perhaps more mature but I still want to keep some of that naivety and hope.

And living in a developing country? Doesn’t feel that different, a few irritations and annoyances but nothing to really remark on. Although Ethiopia is a very different place from most. And once you step outside Addis, you are rapidly plunged into the reality of peoples lives. It makes me appreciate my own life and think about what’s important, but then I felt that even in London.

I’m trying to ensure that we live an authentic life here and don’t survive within the diplo bubble. I think we’ve been largely successful although the vast majority of our friends are in that bubble. We’ve avoided the trappings of car, guard and maid, which makes life harder for Michelle, but she’s adapting to it and finding her own routines.

I don’t know what the future holds – I’d like to think that we’ll feel fully comfortable here and carve out a whole and fulfilled life over time. I’d like to think that there’s a chance we’ll stay and help build this country, but all that depends on whether we can retain some authenticity and I can earn the trust and respect of the ministry.
